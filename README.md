## Project Introduction: Dynamic, Repositionable Text Editor

This project introduces a versatile **Android application** functioning as a **dynamic text editor**. Its primary feature is providing a fluid text area where content changes in real-time, coupled with an innovative **touch-and-move** capability, allowing the text block to be freely repositioned anywhere on the screen.

The application is equipped with a full suite of essential text formatting tools, including options for **bold**, *italic*, and $\underline{\text{underline}}$, as well as simple controls to **increase and decrease text size**. For efficient editing, it includes robust **undo** and **redo** functionality. This combination of dynamic formatting, precise size control, and the unique ability to freely **drag and place** the text makes this a highly flexible and customizable tool for on-screen annotation and text manipulation.
